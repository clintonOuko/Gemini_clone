create the app
add some basic styling that applies to all the pages in the App.css file
in the assets folder, add all the asset images and create a new file assets.js
import all the assets added and then crete a const variable known as assets that exports it 

import history_icon from './history_icon.png'
import menu_icon from './menu_icon.png'

export const assets = {
    history_icon,
    menu_icon,
}
create a components folder in the src folder and add a sidebar folder inside, and a main folder 
in the sidebar folder create a file sidebar.jsx, and a sidebar.css
create a functional component and import the sidebar.css because theyre in the same folder
in the App.js file, instead of returning the className = 'App', return an empty fragment and pass the Sidebar inside it 
We will create all the frontend in the sidebar.js file 
create two divs in the sidebar div
to add an image from the assets, 
    import {assets} from '../../assets/assets
    <img  className='menu' src={assets.menu_icon} alt=" />
after adding all the html to the frontend, style using the classes in the sidebar.css 

// That is all the frontend for the sidebar
