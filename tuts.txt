useState()
its a react hook which lets you define a state to a functional component.
    const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
the state is the current value which you want to be held 
the setState is teh function that you use to update the values . when it is called, the components will rerender the new state value 
example usage :
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
