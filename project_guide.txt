create the app
add some basic styling that applies to all the pages in the App.css file
in the assets folder, add all the asset images and create a new file assets.js
import all the assets added and then crete a const variable known as assets that exports it 

import history_icon from './history_icon.png'
import menu_icon from './menu_icon.png'

export const assets = {
    history_icon,
    menu_icon,
}
create a components folder in the src folder and add a sidebar folder inside, and a main folder 
in the sidebar folder create a file sidebar.jsx, and a sidebar.css
create a functional component and import the sidebar.css because theyre in the same folder
in the App.js file, instead of returning the className = 'App', return an empty fragment and pass the Sidebar inside it 
We will create all the frontend in the sidebar.js file 
create two divs in the sidebar div
to add an image from the assets, 
    import {assets} from '../../assets/assets
    <img  className='menu' src={assets.menu_icon} alt=" />
after adding all the html to the frontend, style using the classes in the sidebar.css 

// TAdding functionalities to the sidebar page
when the menu icon is clicked it expands and reduces the sidebar size
sidebar.jsx>>
    using state variables
    const [extended, setExtended] = useState(false); // when true then the sidebar will be fully displayed but when false it wont be displayed 

const [extended, setExtended]:

This is array destructuring that pulls two elements out of the array returned by useState().
extended: This is the state variable. It holds the current value of the state, which in this case starts as false.
setExtended: This is the function used to update the state. You call this function when you want to change the value of extended.

Now use the above functionality and the ternary operator to check on the sidebar variables and set them as needed
    {extended?<p>New Chat</p>:null} // if true then it will be displayed and if false it wont be displayed 

do this for the recent entry also and the bottom section
                    {extended?<p>Help</p>:null}
after completion the sidebar now reduces its size as it was expected
// Adding the functionality to the button click to set the state variable as false or true 
the function setExtended is defined as an arrow function and passed as an onClick which when clicked toggles the state 
    <img  onClick={()=>{setExtended(prev=>!prev)}} className='menu' src={assets.menu_icon} alt="" />

// Adding fonts to the website 
in google search for outfit font > forms.google.com >> get font >> get embedded code >> import >> copyfirst import link given 
    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap');
in the App.css file add the above link and set the font-family to outfit
